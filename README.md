# CampingDepartmentReports

Instructions for Implementation

This project references a MySQL database that I designed and built to generate reports.
The database is named "Camping Dept.sql" and is included with this repository.

Open the Java IDE of your choice and import the correct library for your system so that the project can access the MySQL database.
Open the DisplayQueryResultsBox class and make sure that the path to the database, username, and password are correct for your machine.  
Adjust it if needed on lines 41-52.  Run the program.
